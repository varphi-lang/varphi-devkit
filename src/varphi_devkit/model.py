"""Data model for representing Varphi language programs.

This module provides the core data types for representing Varphi programs
(Turing machine descriptions) including tape characters, head directions,
and transition rules.

Classes:
    VarphiTapeCharacter: Enum for possible tape characters (0, 1).
    VarphiHeadDirection: Enum for head movement directions (L, R).
    VarphiLine: Dataclass representing a single transition rule.
